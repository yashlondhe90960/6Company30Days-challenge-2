# Sum of Scores of Built Strings
## Description

You are building a string s of length n one character at a time, prepending each new character to the front of the string. The strings are labeled from 1 to n, where the string with length i is labeled si.

For example, for s = "abaca", s1 == "a", s2 == "ca", s3 == "aca", etc.
The score of si is the length of the longest common prefix between si and sn (Note that s == sn).

Given the final string s, return the sum of the score of every si.
 
Example 1:
<!-- ![Alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_01.png) -->

```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

```

Example 2:

![Alt](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/16/find_the_city_02.png)
```
Input: s = "azbazbzaz"
Output: 14
Explanation: 
For s2 == "az", the longest common prefix is "az" which has a score of 2.
For s6 == "azbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azb" which has a score of 3.
For s9 == "azbazbzaz", the longest common prefix is "azbazbzaz" which has a score of 9.
For all other si, the score is 0.
The sum of the scores is 2 + 3 + 9 = 14, so we return 14.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s consists of lowercase English letters.
